1. A math teacher is writing a program that will correctly calculate the area of acircle. Recall that the area of a circle is pi times the radius squared ($\pi r^2$). Assuming Math-PI returnsan accurate decimal approximation of pi, which of the following statements **WILL NOT** calculate an accurate area of a circle with radius 22 ? 

    ```java
    (A) r*r*Math.PI; //r is the int 22 
    (B) r*r*Math.PI; // r is the double 22.0 
    (C) (double) r*r*Math.PI; //r is the int 22 
    (D) (double) (r*r) *Math.PI; // r is the int 22 
    (E) All of the above choices will calculate an accurate area. 
    ```
2. Consider the following code segment: 
   
   ```java
   String s = "This is the beginning";
   String t = s.substring(5);
   int n = t.indexOf ("the");  
   ```
   Which of the following will be the value of n ? 
   ```
    (A) -1 
    (B) 3 
    (C) 7
    (D) 9 
    (E) 8
   ```
