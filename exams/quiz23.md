Questions 5-11 refer to the following Date class declaration: 
```java
public class Date
{
// not finished.............................page-110
} 

```
5. Assume these declarations: 
```java
Rationala a = new Rational();
Rational r = new Rational (num, denom) ; 
int n = value; 
//num, denom.and value are valid integer values 
```
Which of the following will cause a compile-time error! 

```java
(A) r = a.plus(r); 
(B) a = r.plus (new Rational (n)); 
(C) r = r.plus(r);
(D) a = n.plus(r);
(E) r = r.plus (new Rational (n)); 
```
